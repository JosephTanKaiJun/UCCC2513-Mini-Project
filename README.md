# Mini Project Trimester 202406 Tutorial 2 Team No 2
## Traffic Sign Classification
The purpose of this project is to implement deep learning technique to classify the traffic sign image into their relative classes, the datasets that we had utilized is Traffic Sign Recognition Database (TSRD) from Chinese Traffic Sign Database (CTSD), we have applied various data preprocessing technique such as class imbalance handling, normalization etc. We have conducted transfer learning on three models, VGG-16, ResNet-50, and MobileNetV2 and also apply fine-tuning the entire model, only we proceed to evaluate their performance on the test image set

## Datasets
### Introduction
The TSRD includes 6164 traffic sign images containing 58 sign categories. The images are devided into two sub-database as training database and testing database. The training database includes 4170 images while the testing one contains 1994 images. All images are annotated the four corrdinates of the sign and the category.
