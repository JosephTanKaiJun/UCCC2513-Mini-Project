# Mini Project Trimester 202406 Tutorial 2 Team No 2
## Traffic Sign Classification
The purpose of this project is to implement deep learning technique to classify the traffic sign image into their relative classes, the datasets that we had utilized is Traffic Sign Recognition Database (TSRD) from Chinese Traffic Sign Database (CTSD), we have applied various data preprocessing technique such as class imbalance handling, normalization etc. We have conducted transfer learning on three models, VGG-16, ResNet-50, and MobileNetV2 and also apply fine-tuning the entire model, only we proceed to evaluate their performance on the test image set. We also implement GUI for demo on traffic sign classification

## Datasets
### Introduction
The TSRD includes 6164 traffic sign images containing 58 sign categories. The images are devided into two sub-database as training database and testing database. The training database includes 4170 images while the testing one contains 1994 images. All images are annotated the four corrdinates of the sign and the category.

## Data Preprocessing


## Model Transfer Learning and Fine-tuning the entire model


## Installation
1. Go to [TSRD](https://nlpr.ia.ac.cn/PAL/TRAFFICDATA/RECOGNITION.HTML) to download all the dataset and annotation, if only want to try demo, download the [test image dataset](https://nlpr.ia.ac.cn/PAL/TRAFFICDATA/TSRD-Test.zip) should be enough
2. Download the [T2_G2](https://github.com/Luci6n/UCCC2513-Mini-Project-Traffic-Sign-Classification/blob/main/Finalized-Code/T2_G2.ipynb) notebook file to test run our project, otherwise download [Demo](https://github.com/Luci6n/UCCC2513-Mini-Project-Traffic-Sign-Classification/blob/main/Finalized-Code/Demo.ipynb) notebook to just demo on our model
3. Remember to download all the models from our [model](https://github.com/Luci6n/UCCC2513-Mini-Project-Traffic-Sign-Classification/tree/main/Model) directory and allocate them as the same path as the notebook
4. Enjoy!
